		<h1>Culture Of Galle</h1>
		
		<p>From the beginning of time, Galle has been building its rich culture through the colonial eras of the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British.
		All these influences combined with Sri Lankan traditions and Galleâ€™s geographical treasures have turned Galle into an exciting holiday destination. 
		The people of Sri Lanka love cricket and Galle houses the Galle International Cricket Stadium, one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world.
		Little boys can be seen playing cricket on the beach and by the Galle fort as well. 
		Apart from the religious festivals in Galle, there are celebrations of art and culture like food festivals, the Galle Literary Festival and the Galle Music Festival.</p>
