		<h1>Etimology</h2>
		<p>Galle was known as Gimhathitha in ancient times. The term is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese term
			meaning "port near the river Gin". It is believed that the town got its name as Gaalla in the native tongue as a result of
			the large number of bullock carts that took shelter in the area, following the long slow journeys from remote areas of the
			island. "Gaala" in Sinhala means the place where cattle are herded together; hence the Sinhalese name for Galle,
			is a development from 'Gaala'.Another theory is that the word Galle is derived from the Dutch word ‘Gallus’, which
			means rooster. The Dutch have used the rooster as a symbol of Galle, though probably the word comes from the
			Portuguese ‘Galo’ (rooster).</p>
	

		<h1>History of Galle</h1>
		<p>According to James Emerson Tennent, Galle was the ancient seaport of Tarshish, from which King Solomon drew ivory,
			peacocks and other valuables. Cinnamon was exported from Sri Lanka as early as 1400 BC, and as the root of the word
			itself 		is Hebrew, Galle may have been a main entrepot for the spice.[6]

			Inscription 1988 (12th Session)
			Galle had been a prominent seaport long before western rule in the country. Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Malays,
			Indians, and Chinese were doing business through Galle port. In 1411, the Galle Trilingual Inscription, a stone tablet
			inscription in three languages, Chinese, Tamil and Persian, was erected in Galle to commemorate the second visit to Sri
			Lanka by the Chinese admiral Zheng He.
			The modern history of Galle starts in 1502, when a small fleet of Portuguese ships, under the command of Lourenço de
			Almeida, on their way to the Maldives, were blown off course by a storm. Realising that the king resided in Kotte close
			to Colombo, Lourenço proceeded there after a brief stop in Galle.
			In 1640, the Portuguese were forced to surrender to the Dutch East
			India Company. The Dutch built the present fort in 1663. They
			built a fortified solid granite wall and three bastions, known as
			"Sun", "Moon" and "Star".
			After the British took over the country from the Dutch in 1796, the
			British preserved the fort unchanged and used it as the
			administrative centre of the district.

		<h1>A BLINK OF GALLE CITY....</h1>
		<p>
		Located just 119km from Colombo, Galle is one of the major cities of Sri Lanka and also the administrative capital of the Southern Province. It is known for its UNESCO World Heritage Site, the beautifully-preserved Galle Fort. This is the largest, existing sea fortress in South Asia built by the European occupiers.
		The entire city is a blend of classic Portuguese architecture and Sri Lankan traditions, against a spectacular tropical background. This colonial town is quiet with no traffic or pollution. 
		You’ll feel like you’re walking through history as you pass the churches, villas and other reminders of the Dutch era.
		Though the key attraction of Galle is the fort, the other prominent places here are the National Maritime Museum, the natural harbor, St. Mary's Cathedral, Shiva Temple, etc. 
		You can spend your day visiting a turtle hatchery, shop for gems and antiques, walk through the quiet, yet colorful streets of Galle and end the day at the Galle Fort – watching the breath-taking sunset and sipping a cool beverage. 
		Tourists usually include Galle and its neighboring coastal towns (Mirissa, Unawatuna, and Thalpe) because the architecture and atmosphere of Galle gives you a feeling unlike any other place in Sri Lanka.
